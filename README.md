# AsyncPrimes

## Description

This program is a Python implementation of the Prime Sieve algorithm that calculates all prime numbers up to a given limit using asyncio for improved performance. It includes a primary `main()` function that runs the Prime Sieve algorithm and prints the total number of prime numbers found, as well as the total execution time of the program. This program is 100% platform-independent and designed for maximum execution speed.

## Usage

To use the Prime Sieve using Asyncio program, simply run it in a Python 3.11 environment and wait for the results to be printed. The program will calculate all prime numbers up to the given limit using the Prime Sieve algorithm, and print the total number of primes along with the total time the program took to execute, from allocation to freeing.
